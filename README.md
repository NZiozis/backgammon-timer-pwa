## Run for local development

## TODO
- [ ] Customize names for players
- [ ] Consider using templates for player_container ui

## NOTES
- The default assumes that the app is being viewed in portrait mode
  - aka the height is greater than the width
  **THIS MEANS ALL CONDITIONAL STYLES SHOULD BE APPLIED TO LANDSCAPE**
- I intentionally didn't put the template on in the shadowDOM because I just wanted an easy way to repeat UI and wanted to have an easy way of applying JS and styles to the elements


### Setup for orientation query
**CONDITIONAL STYLES SHOULD BE APPLIED TO LANDSCAPE**
/*@media all and (orientation:portrait) {*/
/*	background-color: blue;*/
/*}*/
